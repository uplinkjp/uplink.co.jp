Requires at least: 2.5

Allows you to create additional image sizes (in addition to the thumbnail, medium and large size that are default) for your blog.

== Description ==

With this plugin, users can add and remove intermediate image sizes. The plugin can also make copies of existing images with these new sizes. You will be able to use the images in your posts or use them in your theme with the 'Get the image' plugin or with WordPress 2.9's `the_post_image` feature.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `additional-image-sizes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Now you'll see a new menu item in the `Media` menu where you can add additional sizes and so forth
